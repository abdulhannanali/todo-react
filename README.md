# todoReact

A Todo Application built by using ReactJS, ES6, Node, Babel, Browserify and many more awesome modules.

**Luckily! Live at https://abdulhannanali.github.io/todo-react/**

This app was built during the process of me learning ReactJS and just blew my mind on the subject of how awesome ReactJS is! This was me after seeing the [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react) render the content

At first, JSX was a little bit problem but after 5 minutes, it feels like HTML, actually it's just like HTML but in JavaScript :smile:

## Running this app on your computer
To run this app on your computer first fork and clone this github repo.

Then run the following command in the root directory of the project,
```bash
npm install
```
This command will make sure all the required packages are installed.

In order to build this application, you will also need `gulp-cli`. To install `gulp-cli` type:
```bash
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Typing
```bash
gulp
```
build the project for you. Watch out for `bundle.js` and `bundle.js.map` in the `src/` directory.

Also, if you are using it locally, it's recommended to serve it from an http server such as python http-server or there's also a really awesome node.js one, which I use. Install it by typing
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Launch it
```bash
http-server
```

Now, just go to the localhost port the command output specifies and you are good to go. :smile:
